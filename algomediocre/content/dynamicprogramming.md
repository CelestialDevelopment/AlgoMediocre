### Dynamic Program

## Longest Increasing Subsequence

# Strategic Defense Initiative

Bad news, buddy. Crazy Boris had a bit too much vodka last night and when he woke up this morning, instead of the snooze button
on his alarm clock, he ... well, let me put it this way: we've got tons of nuclear missles flying this way. Unfortunately, all that we have is a chart of the altitudes at which the missles are flying, arranged by the order of arrivals. Go for it, buddy.
Good luck.
