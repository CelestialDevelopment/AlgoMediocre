# Binary Search 
Traditionally used to find particular element in Array, List, Matrix

Preconditions: Sorted already(directional)


# How to Apply Binary Search Hybrids on Leet Code

1. Order-agnostic binary search
2. searching indefinite list
3. search sorted matrix


Given a sorted array of numbers, find out if a given number key is present in the array.
- We do not know if it is ascending or descending

- Duplicates are possible

Example-1: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], key = 5, Output: 4
Example-2: Input: [10, 6, 4], key = 10, Output: 0

```js
  
```
